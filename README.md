*This mod is still work in progress, and [feedback][ISSUES] regarding the balancing of the range or the structures base blocks is highly requested*

The brazier is a multiblock structure similar to the beacon or the conduit, enabling players to prevent mob spawns in a certain radius around it.
This is to solve the problem with players having to always light up their builds on the cost of style/simplicity. 
Spooky castles with moody lighting no longer require you to actually be scared of it or having to move into a mushroom biome.

---

## Usage

The structure is a tower-like build made out of any of the bottom blocks. Each level of the tower expands the range of effect by 10 blocks, with a maximum height of 10.
These values are customizable in the config file.

By lighting a torch on the brazier, you get a living torch. Holding it, you are able to see the outline of the area the brazier covers.

## Aquisition
There are two ways the brazier is crafted using a **Living Flame**.

This rare item is aquired either by finding it in a jungle temple or killing a Crazed Illager in a Mansion.
Both of these ways can be disabled separately in the config.

The **Crazed** is a mage similar to the vindicator. They are able to use two spells, one applying fire resistance to all foes nearby, the other summoning a green flame dealing fire damage.

They are only spawned on generation of a woodland mansion, like the Vindicator, but contrary to them they will not spawn in raids.
